# Properties

Below are the properties you can access. ðŸ–¥

## `user`

- Type: [`StrapiUser`](types#strapiuser)

This object contains details about the authenticated user, which you can access using `strapi.user`.

::code-group
  ```ts [Getter]
  strapi.user;
  ```
  ```ts [Setter]
  strapi.user.avatar = "";
  ```
::

## `axios`

You have access to the axios instance through `strapi.axios`. This allows you to set new headers or extend it:

```ts
strapi.axios.defaults.headers.common["Authorization"] = `Bearer myToken`;
```

Note that we use [axios interceptors](https://axios-http.com/docs/interceptors) in order to synchronize your JWT token in header.

> Check out the [Axios documentation](https://github.com/axios/axios) for more information.
